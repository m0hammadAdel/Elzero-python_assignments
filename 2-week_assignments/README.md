# Week 2 Assignments
in this week the main study plan was for more understanding  strings.
-Indexing And Slicing.
-Important String Methods.
-String Formatting.

### Important String Methods:
-len(): returns the sum of characters of the string "or elements of a list".

-strep(): trim white spaces at the start and the end of a string (second argument could take a special string or any string to delete).

-rstrep(): does the exact same function as strep() but only at the start of the sting.

-lstrep(): does the exact same function as strep() but only at the end of the string.

-title(): replace every first character of a word or a character after a number with a capital letter.

-capitalize(): replace the first character of word with a capital letter in the entire string.

-zfill(): takes one argument as a width and replace zeroes with every blank digit below the width.

-upper(): convert every character in the string with uppercase letter.

-lower(): convert every character in the string with lowercase letter.

-split(): take every word in a string and put it in a separate list as a string (takes one argument to split upon).

-center(): takes two argument the first one is the width of the string and second one is the character to center the string in.

-count(): take one argument in the type string and return the number of times it repeated in the same string second and third argument are optional to address the start and the end of the search.

-swapecase(): revert every character in the string if it's capital it will be small and vise versa.

-startwith(): take one char argument to check if the string starts with the same letter.

-endwith(): take one char argument to check if the string ends with the same letter.

-index(): take one argument to search for it and returns the index it's located in or throws error if it's not found.

-find(): take one argument to search for it and returns the index it's located in or -1 if it's not found.

-rjust(), ljust(): takes two argument width and fill width is the length of the string + number of fillers needed.

splitlines(): return a list with every string been divided with a new line.

expandtabs(): control the number of space of the escape sequence /t.

istitle(): returns true if every first character of a word or a character after a number with a capital letter.

isspace(): check if the entire string is all spaces and return true.

islowre(): return true if the hole string is in lowercase characters.

isidentifier(): return true if the string can be variable name.

isalpha(); return true if the string is all alphabetical characters.

isalnum(): return true if the string contains alphabetical characters or numbers only.

join(): takes iterable object and join it's elements in a single string.
